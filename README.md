# Restaurants-Suggestion
The aim of this project is to develop a model for the prediction of the priority list of restaurants from the available restaurants by taking the dish and budget as customer input. In this project, we analyzed the Zomato Dataset, and using sentiment analysis, text analytics, observing word clouds, DTM, and tf-idf matrices, we have developed a model to recommend the priority list of restaurants for the searched dish and budget. We have used a decision tree classification algorithm, for the classification of restaurants based on available budget, rating of the restaurant, and extra features provided. This model will help the customer to get a priority list of restaurants.
